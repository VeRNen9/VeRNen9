Hi, I’m @VeRNen9 (Rohit)

Focus: I live at the intersection of Data Engineering, Data Science, and Visualization. I enjoy building the pipelines, running the models, and showing off the results.

Learning: Currently diving deep into Kubernetes and AWS to make sure my data solutions are as scalable as they are smart.

Experience: I’ve spent my time building predictive models, designing ETL workflows, and creating dashboards that actually tell a story.

Collaboration: I’m looking to jump into projects involving end-to-end data systems, especially anything involving time-series analysis or complex data orchestration.

Contact: Drop me a line at nekki.vr@gmail.com. Let’s build something cool.
